# How to use:
#  Items in a week are grouped together under week #X. An item
#  can has 'class: true' or 'class: false'. This is the only required
#  parameter.
#
#  When class is true, it is given an automatic classnumber and date,
#  though a manual date may be given with the 'date' parameter.
#
#  Items may have topics, assign, and due. All three are optional.
#
#  Each of topics, assign, and due are treated the same. There is a
#  required 'name' parameter, and and optional 'special' and 'link'
#  parameters. A link may contain anything that fits in an href,
#  and special attaches an HTML class to the finished cell.
#  Built-in options include 'cancelled', 'guest', 'tba',
#  'hackathon', and others.
#
#  You can have as many parts to topics, assign, or due as
#  you like.
