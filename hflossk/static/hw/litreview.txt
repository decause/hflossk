Literature Review

This is not a literature course, but as a member of the FOSS community, there
are many texts to grok to help you down the path. The instructor has provided
some texts, and many more were contributed by other Professors, hackers, and
community members who thought these works were important enough to share with
graduating college students about to enter the "real-world." 

As far as this instructor is concerned, you should at the very minimum be able
to remember the basics:

    The Gist
        You're in a social setting. Someone says "Hey, did you ever read X?"
        You quickly respond "Oh heck yeah! X was teh {awesome,suck}!" The
        person next to you in the circle says "Oh snap, I didn't read X. What
        was it about...?" 

        ..You have exactly 3 lines, MAX, to prove you are not a hipster--and
        "The Gist" is those 3 lines.

        were lolzy.

    The Bad
    3 things that: 
        you thought were bad

    Your Review
        Imagine you are on Yelp, Amazon, Ebay, Netflix, or any other online
        community that has customer reviews. This is the message that you want
        to leave behind, to represent yourself, and inform (or warn) others.
        You should add a quick rating system of your choosing (X/Y stars, X thumbs
        up) as part of the review.
