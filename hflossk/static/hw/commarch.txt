“Commarch” -- Community Architecture

Open Source Community Characterization Assignment

Working in groups of two or three (formed during class), you are going to look
at FOSS community/project and deduce how that community is organized. You may
also use some of these techniques to assess pre-existing FOSS projects you wish
to contribute to for your term project (highly recommended!)

0.  Choose your team. We'll be doing this in class, and teams must be approved
    by your instructor.

1.  Choose a FOSS Project. You can use Ohloh.net and OpenHatch.org collect
    general information on Free/Open Source projects (including games!). Select
    one active software project about which to write. Have an alternative handy
    if you find that you cannot get much information about your first choice.
    Project choices must be approved by your instructor.

2.  Follow the instructions included in the "Git By A Bus" repository on Github
    to generate a report on your selected project, available here:
    https://github.com/tomheon/git_by_a_bus

3.  Calculate your project's "Callaway Coefficient of Fail" using the rubric available here:
    http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/books/tomspotcallaway-howtotellifyourfossprojectisdoomedtofail.pdf

4.  Dig deeper. Provide answers to the following questions:

    If applicable, list or provide links to:
        I.      The project's IRC Channel
        II      Source Code repository
        III.    Mail list archive
        IV.     Documentation 
        V.      Other communication channels
        VI.     Project Website and/or Blog

    A.  Describe software project, its purpose and goals.

    B.  Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The
        latest commit?

    C.  Who approves patches? How many people?

    D.  Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many
        total?

    E.  Who has the highest amounts of "Unique Knowledge?" (As per your
        "Git-by-a-bus" report. If there is a tie, list each contributor, with
        links if possible)

    F.  What is your project's "Calloway Coefficient of Fail?"

    G.  Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the same
        top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has
        it changed?)

    H.  Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL ==
        Benevolent Dictator for Life)

    I.  Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the
        proportion of each?

    J.  What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have
        arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control
        and bug repair?

    K.  How is the project's participation trending and why?

    L.  In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?"
        (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active
        contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

    M.  In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or
        most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

    N.  Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?
        (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus
        specifically on newbies, etc...)

    O.  Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?
        Does it include code examples?

    P.  If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into
        trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

    Q.  Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
        structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus
        building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled
        by a single or pair of individuals?

    R.  Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or
        why not?

5.  Write up a set of answers to these questions including how you arrived at
    your conclusions (links, convo quotes, irc logs, email threads, etc.) to be
    posted to your blogs individually. Each member can link to the same
    analysis, but should give a personal account "in your own voice."

6.  Prepare in a brief slide-deck to present as a group to the class based on
    your research.
