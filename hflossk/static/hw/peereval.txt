HFOSS Peer Evaluation

Please complete one for each member of your team besides yourself. You want to
attempt to be objective, but you also need to have an opinion that you can
support with evidence. Part of your grade is going to be based not only on how
your rate your peers, but how well you rate your peers i.e. are your ratings of
your peers thoughtful and well justified. Take this seriously; you will be
asked to do this in the professional world from time to time.
