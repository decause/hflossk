		<p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile the brightest 
minds of Silicon Valley are “disrupting” whatever industry is too 
crippled to fend off their advances, something odd is happening to our 
language. Old, trusted words no longer mean what they used to mean; 
often, they don’t mean anything at all. Our language, much like 
everything these days, has been hacked. Fuzzy, contentious, and complex 
ideas have been stripped of their subversive connotations and replaced 
by cleaner, shinier, and emptier alternatives; long-running debates 
about politics, rights, and freedoms have been recast in the seemingly 
natural language of economics, innovation, and efficiency. Complexity, 
as it turns out, is not particularly viral.</p>
<div style="float:right"><a href="mailto:burke.philipburke@gmail.com"><img class="imageright" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_burke3_oreilly_308.png" alt=" "></a></div>
<p class="parabody">This is not to deny that many of our latest gadgets 
and apps are fantastic. But to fixate on technological innovation alone 
is to miss the more subtle—and more consequential—ways in which a clique
 of techno-entrepreneurs has hijacked our language and, with it, our 
reason. In the last decade or so, Silicon Valley has triggered its own 
wave of linguistic innovation, a wave so massive that a completely new 
way to analyze and describe the world—a silicon mentality of sorts—has 
emerged in its wake. The old language has been rendered useless; our 
pre-Internet vocabulary, we are told, needs an upgrade.</p><p class="parabody">Fortunately,
 Silicon Valley, that never-drying well of shoddy concepts and dubious 
paradigms—from wiki-everything to i-something, from e-nothing to 
open-anything—is ready to help. Like a good priest, it’s always there to
 console us with the promise of a better future, a glitzier roadmap, a 
sleeker vocabulary.</p><p class="parabody">Silicon Valley has always had
 a thing for priests; Steve Jobs was the cranky pope it deserved. Today,
 having mastered the art of four-hour workweeks and gluten-free lunches 
in outdoor cafeterias, our digital ministers are beginning to preach on 
subjects far beyond the funky world of drones, 3-D printers, and smart 
toothbrushes. That we would eventually be robbed of a meaningful 
language to discuss technology was entirely predictable. That the 
conceptual imperialism of Silicon Valley would also pollute the rest of 
our vocabulary wasn’t.</p><p class="parabody">The enduring emptiness of 
our technology debates has one main cause, and his name is Tim O’Reilly.
 The founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media, a seemingly omnipotent publisher
 of technology books and a tireless organizer of trendy conferences, 
O’Reilly is one of the most influential thinkers in Silicon Valley. 
Entire fields of thought—from computing to management theory to public 
administration—have already surrendered to his buzzwordophilia, but 
O’Reilly keeps pressing on. Over the past fifteen years, he has given us
 such gems of analytical precision as “open source,” “Web 2.0,” 
“government as a platform,” and “architecture of participation.” 
O’Reilly doesn’t coin all of his favorite expressions, but he promotes 
them with religious zeal and enviable perseverance. While Washington 
prides itself on Frank Luntz, the Republican strategist who rebranded 
“global warming” as “climate change” and turned “estate tax” into “death
 tax,” Silicon Valley has found its own Frank Luntz in Tim O’Reilly. </p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">T</span>racing O’Reilly’s intellectual footprint is no easy task, in part because it’s so vast.<span id="anchor"><a href="#footnote1">[*]</a></span>
 Through his books, blogs, and conferences, he’s nurtured a whole 
generation of technology thinkers, from Clay Shirky to Cory Doctorow. A 
prolific blogger and a <a href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly">compulsive Twitter user</a> with more than 1.6 million followers, O’Reilly has a knack for writing articulate essays about technological change. <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1008839">His essay on “Web 2.0”</a>
 elucidated a basic philosophy of the Internet in a way accessible to 
both academics and venture capitalists; it boasts more than <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;authuser=0#hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22What+is+Web+2.0:+Design+patterns+and+business+models+for+the+next+generation+of+software%22&amp;oq=%22What+is+Web+2.0:+Design+patterns+and+business+models+for+the+next+generation+of+software%22&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i30l4.9871.10733.1.10940.3.3.0.0.0.0.66.170.3.3.0%E2%80%A60.0%E2%80%A61c.1.7.serp.ixWALPE7kd4&amp;psj=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;fp=ed026ff60bd20b9e&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=620">six thousand references</a> on Google Scholar—not bad for a non-academic author. He also <a href="http://oatv.com/portfolio.html">invests in start-ups</a>—the very start-ups that he celebrates in his public advocacy—through a<a href="http://oatv.com/"> venture fund</a>, which, like most things O’Reilly, also bears his name.</p><p class="parabody">A
 stylish and smooth-talking self-promoter with a philosophical take on 
everything, O’Reilly is the Bernard-Henri Lévy of Route 101, the 
favorite court philosopher of the TED elites. His impressive 
intellectual stature in the Valley can probably be attributed to the 
simple fact that he is much better read than your average tech 
entrepreneur. His constant references to the learned men of 
yesteryear—from “<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/handicapping-internet-platform-wars.html">Archilochus, the Greek fabulist</a>” to <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/05/google-wave-what-might-email-l.html">Ezra Pound</a>—make
 him stand out from all those Silicon Valley college dropouts who don’t 
know their Plotinus from their Pliny. A onetime recipient of a<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.10/oreilly_pr.html"> National Endowment for the Arts grant</a> to translate Greek fables—“<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/06/benefits-classical-education.html">Socrates is [one of] my constant companions</a>”—he
 has the air of a man ready to grapple with the Really Big Questions of 
the Universe (his Harvard degree in classics certainly comes in handy). 
While he recently <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/12/mf-tim-oreilly-qa/all/">told <em>Wired</em></a>
 that he doesn’t “really give a shit if literary novels go away” because
 “they’re an elitist pursuit,” O’Reilly is also quick to acknowledge 
that novels have profoundly shaped his own life. In 1981 the young 
O’Reilly even <a href="http://oreilly.com/tim/herbert/">wrote a reputable biography</a> of the science fiction writer Frank Herbert, the author of the <em>Dune</em> series, in which he waxes lyrical about Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers.</p><p class="parabody">Alas,
 O’Reilly and the dead Germans parted ways long ago. These days, he’s 
busy changing the world; any list of unelected technocrats who are 
shaping the future of American politics would have his name at the very 
top. A Zelig-like presence on both sides of the Atlantic, he hobnobs 
with government officials in Washington and London, advising them on the
 Next Big Thing. <a href="http://oreilly.com/tim/gov2/">O’Reilly’s thinking on “Government 2.0”</a>
 has influenced many bureaucrats in the Obama administration, 
particularly those tasked with promoting the amorphous ideal of “open 
government”—not an easy thing to do in an administration bent on 
prosecuting whistle-blowers and dispatching drones to 
“we-can’t-tell-you-where-exactly” destinations. O’Reilly is also active 
in discussions about the <a href="http://oreilly.com/tim/healthcare/">future of health care</a>, having strong views on what “health 2.0” should be like.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>A
 stylish and smooth-talking self-promoter with a philosophical take on 
everything, Tim O’Reilly is the Bernard-Henri Lévy of Route 101, the 
favorite court philosopher of the TED elites.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">None of this is necessarily bad. On 
first impression, O’Reilly seems like a much-needed voice of reason—even
 of civic spirit—in the shallow and ruthless paradise-ghetto that is 
Silicon Valley. Compared to ultra-libertarian technology mavens like 
Peter Thiel and Kevin Kelly, O’Reilly might even be mistaken for a 
bleeding-heart liberal. He has publicly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/10/why-i-support-barack-obama.html">endorsed Obama</a>
 and supported many of his key reforms. He has called on young software 
developers—the galley slaves of Silicon Valley—to work on “<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html">stuff that matters</a>”
 (albeit preferably in the private sector). He has written favorably 
about the work of little-known local officials transforming American 
cities. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbruner/2011/03/25/tim-oreilly-on-piracy-tinkering-and-the-future-of-the-book/">O’Reilly once said</a> that his company’s vision is to “change the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators,” while his own <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=3103">personal credo</a>
 is to “create more value than you capture.” (And he has certainly 
captured a lot of it: his publishing empire, once in the humble business
 of producing technical manuals, is now <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/Sy8Z2uWy655?hl=en">worth $100 million</a>.)
 Helping like-minded people find each other, sharpen their message, form
 a social movement, and change the world: this is what O’Reilly’s empire
 is all about. <a href="http://oreilly.com/">Its website even boasts</a>
 of its “long history of advocacy, meme-making, and evangelism.” Who 
says that spiritual gurus can’t have their own venture funds?</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly’s personal journey was not atypical for Silicon Valley. In a 2004 essay about his favorite books (published in <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020080.do">Tim O’Reilly in a Nutshell</a></em>, brought out by O’Reilly Media), O’Reilly confessed that, as a young man, he had “<a href="http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/favebooks_0705.html">hopes of writing deep books</a>
 that would change the world.” O’Reilly credits a book of science 
fiction documenting the struggles of a young girl against a 
corporate-dominated plutocracy (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rissa-Kerguelen-Book-one-saga/dp/0399117911">Rissa Kerguelen</a></em>
 by F. M. Busby) with helping him abandon his earlier dream of 
revolutionary writing and enter the “fundamentally trivial business [of]
 technical writing.” The book depicted entrepreneurship as a “subversive
 force,” convincing O’Reilly that “in a world dominated by large 
companies, it is the smaller companies that keep freedom alive, with 
economics at least one of the battlegrounds.” This tendency to view 
questions of freedom primarily through the lens of economic competition,
 to focus on the producer and the entrepreneur at the expense of 
everyone else, shaped O’Reilly’s thinking about technology.</p>
<div style="float:right"><a href="http://www.marksfisher.com/"><img class="imageright" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher1_joe2.png" alt=" "></a></div><p class="parabody">The
 Randian undertones in O’Reilly’s thinking are hard to miss, even as he 
flaunts his liberal credentials. “There’s a way in which the O’Reilly 
brand essence is ultimately a story about the hacker as hero, the kid 
who is playing with technology because he loves it, but one day falls 
into a situation where he or she is called on to go forth and change the
 world,” <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/CLJmemTBMgf">he wrote in 2012</a>.
 But it’s not just the hacker as hero that O’Reilly is so keen to 
celebrate. His true hero is the hacker-cum-entrepreneur, someone who 
overcomes the insurmountable obstacles erected by giant corporations and
 lazy bureaucrats in order to fulfill the American Dream 2.0: start a 
company, disrupt an industry, coin a buzzword. Hiding beneath this 
glossy veneer of disruption-talk is the same old gospel of 
individualism, small government, and market fundamentalism that we 
associate with Randian characters. For Silicon Valley and its idols, 
innovation is the new selfishness. </p><p class="parabody">However, it’s
 not his politics that makes O’Reilly the most dangerous man in Silicon 
Valley; a burgeoning enclave of Randian thought, it brims with far 
nuttier cases. O’Reilly’s mastery of public relations, on the other 
hand, is unrivaled and would put many of Washington’s top spin doctors 
to shame. No one has done more to turn important debates about 
technology—debates that used to be about rights, ethics, and 
politics—into kumbaya celebrations of the entrepreneurial spirit while 
making it seem as if the language of economics was, in fact, the only 
reasonable way to talk about the subject. As O’Reilly discovered a long 
time ago, memes are for losers; the real money is in epistemes.</p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">O</span>’Reilly
 got his start in business in 1978 when he launched a consulting firm 
that specialized in technical writing. Six years later, it began 
retaining rights to some of the manuals it was producing for individual 
clients and gradually branched out into more mainstream publishing. By 
the mid-1990s, O’Reilly had achieved some moderate success in Silicon 
Valley. He was well-off, having found a bestseller in <em>The Whole Internet User’s Guide and Catalog</em> and having sold the Global Network Navigator—possibly the first Internet portal to feature paid banner advertising (“<a href="http://oreilly.com/gnn/">the first commercial website</a>” as O’Reilly describes it today)—to AOL.</p><p class="parabody">It
 was the growing popularity of “open source software” that turned 
O’Reilly into a national (and, at least in geek circles, international) 
figure. “Open source software” was also the first major rebranding 
exercise overseen by Team O’Reilly. This is where he tested all his 
trademark discursive interventions: hosting a summit to define the 
concept, penning provocative essays to refine it, producing a host of 
books and events to popularize it, and cultivating a network of thinkers
 to proselytize it.</p><div style="float:right"><a href="http://www.marksfisher.com/"><img class="imageright" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher2_internetgod_308.png" alt=" "></a></div><p class="parabody">It’s
 easy to forget this today, but there was no such idea as open source 
software before 1998; the concept’s seeming contemporary coherence is 
the result of clever manipulation and marketing. Open source software 
was born out of an ideological cleavage between two groups that, at 
least before 1998, had been traditionally lumped together. In one corner
 stood a group of passionate and principled geeks, led by Richard 
Stallman of the Free Software Foundation, preoccupied with ensuring that
 users had rights with respect to their computer programs. Those rights 
weren’t many—users should be able to run the program for any purpose, to
 study how it works, to redistribute copies of it, and to release their 
improved version (if there was one) to the public—but even this seemed 
revolutionary compared to what one could do with most proprietary 
software sold at the time.</p><p class="parabody">Software that ensured 
the aforementioned four rights was dubbed “free software.” It was “free”
 thanks to its association with “freedom” rather than “free beer”; there
 was no theoretical opposition to charging money for building and 
maintaining such software. To provide legal cover, Stallman invented an 
ingenious license that relied on copyright law to suspend its own most 
draconian provisions—a legal trick that came to be known as “copyleft.” 
GPL (short for “General Public License”) has become the most famous and 
widely used of such “copyleft” licenses.</p><p class="parabody">From its
 very beginning in the early 1980s, Stallman’s movement aimed to produce
 a free software alternative to proprietary operating systems like Unix 
and Microsoft Windows and proprietary software like Microsoft Office. 
Stallman’s may not have been the best software on offer, but some 
sacrifice of technological efficiency was a price worth paying for 
emancipation. Some discomfort might even be desirable, for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">Stallman’s goal</a>,
 as he put it in his 1998 essay “Why ‘Free Software’ is Better Than 
‘Open Source,’” was to ask “people to think about things they might 
rather ignore.”</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>As O’Reilly discovered a long time ago, memes are for losers; the real money is in epistemes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="parabody">Underpinning Stallman’s project was a profound 
critique of the role that patent law had come to play in stifling 
innovation and creativity. Perhaps inadvertently, Stallman also made a 
prescient argument for treating code, and technological infrastructure 
more broadly, as something that ought to be subject to public scrutiny. 
He sought to open up the very technological black boxes that 
corporations conspired to keep shut. Had his efforts succeeded, we might
 already be living in a world where the intricacies of software used for
 high-frequency trading or biometric identification presented no major 
mysteries.</p><p class="parabody">Stallman is highly idiosyncratic, to 
put it mildly, and there are many geeks who don’t share his agenda. 
Plenty of developers contributed to “free software” projects for reasons
 that had nothing to do with politics. Some, like Linus Torvalds, the 
Finnish creator of the much-celebrated Linux operating system, did so 
for fun; some because they wanted to build more convenient software; 
some because they wanted to learn new and much-demanded skills.</p><p class="parabody">Once
 the corporate world began expressing interest in free software, many 
nonpolitical geeks sensed a lucrative business opportunity. As 
technology entrepreneur <a href="http://oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/tiemans.html">Michael Tiemann put it in 1999</a>,
 while Stallman’s manifesto “read like a socialist polemic . . . I saw 
something different. I saw a business plan in disguise.” Stallman’s 
rights-talk, however, risked alienating the corporate types. Stallman 
didn’t care about offending the suits, as his goal was to convince 
ordinary users to choose free software on ethical grounds, not to sell 
it to business types as a cheaper or more efficient alternative to 
proprietary software. After all, he was trying to launch a radical 
social movement, not a complacent business association.</p><p class="parabody">By
 early 1998 several business-minded members of the free software 
community were ready to split from Stallman, so they masterminded a 
coup, formed their own advocacy outlet—the Open Source Initiative—and 
brought in O’Reilly to help them rebrand. The timing was right. Netscape
 had just marked its capitulation to Microsoft in the so-called Browser 
Wars and promised both that all future versions of Netscape Communicator
 would be released free of charge and that its code would also be made 
publicly available. A few months later, O’Reilly organized a<a href="http://oreilly.com/oreilly/press/freeware.html"> much-publicized summit</a>,
 where a number of handpicked loyalists—Silicon democracy in 
action!—voted for “open source” as their preferred label. Stallman was 
not invited.</p><p class="parabody">The label “open source” may have 
been new, but the ideas behind it had been in the air for some time. In 
1997, even before the coup, Eric Raymond—a close associate of O’Reilly, a
 passionate libertarian, and the founder of a group with the 
self-explanatory title “Geeks with Guns”—delivered a brainy talk called “<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>,”
 which foresaw the emergence of a new, radically collaborative way to 
make software. (In 1999, O’Reilly turned it into a successful book.) 
Emphasizing its highly distributed nature, Raymond captured the essence 
of open source software in a big-paradigm kind of way that could 
spellbind McKinsey consultants and leftist academics alike.</p>
<div style="float:right"><a href="http://www.marksfisher.com/"><img class="imageright" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher3_bssurvayer_308.png" alt=" "></a></div><p class="parabody">In those early days, the messaging around open source occasionally bordered on propaganda. <a href="http://oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/raymond2.html">As Raymond himself put it in 1999</a>, “what we needed to mount was in effect a <em>marketing campaign</em>,”
 one that “would require marketing techniques (spin, image-building, and
 re-branding) to make it work.” This budding movement prided itself on 
not wanting to talk about the ends it was pursuing; except for improving
 efficiency and decreasing costs, those were left very much undefined. 
Instead, it put all the emphasis on <em>how </em>it was pursuing those 
ends—in an extremely decentralized manner, using Internet platforms, 
with little central coordination. In contrast to free software, then, 
open source had no obvious moral component. <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/media-copyrightlaw/article_246.jsp">According to Raymond</a>,
 “open source is not particularly a moral or a legal issue. It’s an 
engineering issue. I advocate open source, because . . . it leads to 
better engineering results and better economic results.” O’Reilly 
concurred. “I don’t think it’s a religious issue. It’s really about how 
do we actually encourage and spark innovation,” he <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10264471-16.html">announced a decade later</a>.
 While free software was meant to force developers to lose sleep over 
ethical dilemmas, open source software was meant to end their insomnia.</p><p class="parabody">Even
 before the coup, O’Reilly occupied an ambiguous—and commercially 
pivotal—place in the free software community. On the one hand, he 
published manuals that helped to train new converts to the cause. On the
 other hand, those manuals were pricey. They were also of excellent 
quality, which, as Stallman once complained, discouraged the community 
from producing inexpensive alternatives. Ultimately, however, the 
disagreement between Stallman and O’Reilly—and the latter soon became 
the most visible cheerleader of the open source paradigm—probably had to
 do with their very different roles and aspirations. Stallman the social
 reformer could wait for decades until his ethical argument for free 
software prevailed in the public debate. O’Reilly the savvy businessman 
had a much shorter timeline: a quick embrace of open source software by 
the business community guaranteed steady demand for O’Reilly books and 
events, especially at a time when some analysts were beginning to 
worry—and for good reason, as it turned out—that the tech industry was 
about to collapse.</p><p class="parabody">The coup succeeded. Stallman’s
 project was marginalized. But O’Reilly and his acolytes didn’t win with
 better arguments; they won with better PR. To make his narrative about 
open source software credible to a public increasingly fascinated by the
 Internet, O’Reilly produced a highly particularized account of the 
Internet that subsequently took on a life of its own. In just a few 
years, that narrative became the standard way to talk about Internet 
history, giving it the kind of neat intellectual coherence that it never
 actually had. A decade after producing a singular vision of the 
Internet to justify his ideas about the supremacy of the open source 
paradigm, O’Reilly is close to pulling a similar trick on how we talk 
about government reform.</p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o
 understand how O’Reilly’s idea of the Internet helped legitimize the 
open source paradigm, it’s important to remember that much of Stallman’s
 efforts centered on software licenses. O’Reilly’s bet was that as 
software migrated from desktops to servers—what, in another fit of 
buzzwordophilia, we later called the “cloud”—licenses would cease to 
matter. Since no code changed hands when we used Google or Amazon, it 
was counterproductive to fixate on licenses. “Let’s stop thinking about 
licenses for a little bit. Let’s stop thinking that that’s the core of 
what matters about open source,” O’Reilly urged in an<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/tim-oreilly-software-licenses-dont-work-261"> interview with <em>InfoWorld</em></a> in 2003.</p><p class="parabody">So
 what did matter about open source? Not “freedom”—at least not in 
Stallman’s sense of the word. O’Reilly cared for only one type of 
freedom: the freedom of developers to distribute software on whatever 
terms they fancied. This was the freedom of the producer, the Randian 
entrepreneur, who must be left to innovate, undisturbed by laws and 
ethics. The most important freedom, as O’Reilly put it in a<a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/08/15/oreilly_response.html"> 2001 exchange with Stallman</a>,
 is that which protects “my choice as a creator to give, or not to give,
 the fruits of my work to you, as a ‘user’ of that work, and for you, as
 a user, to accept or reject the terms I place on that gift.”</p><p class="parabody">This
 stood in stark contrast to Stallman’s plan of curtailing—by appeals to 
ethics and, one day, perhaps, law—the freedom of developers in order to 
promote the freedom of users. O’Reilly <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/900">opposed this agenda</a>:
 “I completely support the right of Richard [Stallman] or any individual
 author to make his or her work available under the terms of the GPL; I 
balk when they say that others who do not do so are doing something 
wrong.” The right thing to do, according to O’Reilly, was to leave 
developers alone. “I am willing to accept any argument that says that 
there are advantages and disadvantages to any particular licensing 
method. . . . My moral position is that people should be free to find 
out what works for them,” <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/900">he wrote in 2001</a>.
 That “what works” for developers might eventually hurt everyone 
else—which was essentially Stallman’s argument—did not bother O’Reilly. 
For all his economistic outlook, he was not one to talk externalities.</p>
<div style="float: right"><a href="http://www.marksfisher.com/"><img class="imageright" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher4_crush_308.png" alt=" "></a></div>
<p class="parabody">According to this Randian interpretation of open 
source, the goal of regulation and public advocacy should be to ensure 
that absolutely nothing—no laws or petty moral considerations—stood in 
the way of the open source revolution. Any move to subject the fruits of
 developers’ labor to public regulation, even if its goal was to promote
 a greater uptake of open source software, must be opposed, since it 
would taint the reputation of open source as technologically and 
economically superior to proprietary software. Occasionally this stance 
led to paradoxes, as, for example, during a <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/02/08/16/1621244/tim-oreilly-bashes-open-source-efforts-in-govt">heated 2002 debate</a>
 on whether governments should be required to ditch Microsoft and switch
 to open source software. O’Reilly expressed his vehement opposition to 
such calls. “No one should be forced to choose open source, any more 
than they should be forced to choose proprietary software. And any 
victory for open source achieved through deprivation of the user’s right
 to choose would indeed be a betrayal of the principles that free 
software and open source have stood for,” O’Reilly wrote in a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1840">widely discussed blog post</a>.</p><p class="parabody">That
 such an argument could be mounted reveals just how much political 
baggage was smuggled into policy debates once “open source software” 
replaced “free software” as the idiom of choice. Governments are 
constantly pushed to do things someone in the private sector may not 
like; why should the software industry be special? Promoting 
accountability or improving network security might indeed disrupt 
someone’s business model—but so what? Once a term like “open source” 
entered our vocabulary, one could recast the whole public policy 
calculus in very different terms, so that instead of discussing the 
public interest, we are discussing the interests of individual software 
developers, while claiming that this is a discussion about “innovation” 
and “progress,” not “accountability” or “security.” </p><p class="parabody">To
 weaken Stallman’s position, O’Reilly had to show that the free software
 movement was fighting a pointless, stupid war: the advent of the 
Internet made Stallman’s obsession with licenses obsolete. There was a 
fair amount of semantic manipulation at play here. For Stallman, 
licenses were never an end in themselves; they mattered only as much as 
they codified a set of practices deriving from his vision of a 
technologically mediated good life. Licenses, in other words, were just 
the means to enable the one and only end that mattered to free software 
advocates: freedom. A different set of technological practices—e.g., the
 move from desktop-run software to the cloud—could have easily 
accommodated a different means of ensuring that freedom.</p><p class="parabody">In
 fact, Stallman’s philosophy, however rudimentary, had all the right 
conceptual tools to let us think about the desirability of moving 
everything to the cloud. The ensuing assault on privacy, the 
centralization of data in the hands of just a handful of companies, the 
growing accessibility of user data to law enforcement agencies who don’t
 even bother getting a warrant: all those consequences of cloud 
computing could have been predicted and analyzed, even if fighting those
 consequences would have required tools other than licenses. O’Reilly’s 
PR genius lay in having almost everyone confuse the means and the ends 
of the free software movement. Since licenses were obsolete, the 
argument went, software developers could pretty much disregard the ends 
of Stallman’s project (i.e., its focus on user rights and freedoms) as 
well. Many developers did stop thinking about licenses, and, having 
stopped thinking about licenses, they also stopped thinking about 
broader moral issues that would have remained central to the debates had
 “open source” not displaced “free software” as the paradigm du jour. 
Sure, there were exceptions—like the highly political and legalistic 
community that worked on Debian, yet another operating system—but they 
were the exceptions that proved the rule.</p><p class="parabody">To 
maximize the appeal and legitimacy of this new paradigm, O’Reilly had to
 establish that open source both predated free software and was well on 
its way to conquering the world—that it had a rich history and a rich 
future. The first objective he accomplished, in part, by exploiting the 
ambiguities of the term “open”; the second by framing debate about the 
Internet around its complex causal connections to open source software.</p><div style="float: right"><a href="http://www.marksfisher.com/"><img style="margin-left:10px" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher5_globalbrain_308.png" alt=" "></a></div>
<p class="parabody">The term “open source” was not invented by O’Reilly.
 Christine Peterson, the cofounder of Foresight Institute (a 
nanotechnology think tank), coined it in a February 1998 brainstorm 
session convened to react to Netscape’s release of Navigator’s source 
code. Few words in the English language pack as much ambiguity and 
sexiness as “open.” And after O’Reilly’s bombastic interventions—“Open 
allows experimentation. Open encourages competition. Open wins,” <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/22/kindle-oreilly-ebooks-technology-breakthroughs_oreilly.html">he once proclaimed</a>
 in an essay—its luster has only intensified. Profiting from the term’s 
ambiguity, O’Reilly and his collaborators likened the “openness” of open
 source software to the “openness” of the academic enterprise, markets, 
and free speech. “Open” thus could mean virtually anything, from “open 
to intellectual exchange” (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000119094723/http://sunworld.com/sunworldonline/swol-01-1999/swol-01-regex-2.html">O’Reilly in 1999</a>:
 “Once you start thinking of computer source code as a human language, 
you see open source as a variety of ‘free speech’”) to “open to 
competition” (<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4179">O’Reilly in 2000</a>:
 “For me, ‘open source’ in the broader sense means any system in which 
open access to code lowers the barriers to entry into the market”). </p><p class="parabody">“Open”
 allowed O’Reilly to build the largest possible tent for the movement. 
The language of economics was less alienating than Stallman’s language 
of ethics; “openness” was the kind of multipurpose term that allowed one
 to look political while advancing an agenda that had very little to do 
with politics. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/handicapping-internet-platform-wars.html">As O’Reilly put it in 2010</a>,
 “the art of promoting openness is not to make it a moral crusade, but 
rather to highlight the competitive advantages of openness.” Replace 
“openness” with any other loaded term—say “human rights”—in this 
sentence, and it becomes clear that this quest for “openness” was 
politically toothless from the very outset. What, after all, if your 
interlocutor doesn’t give a damn about competitive advantages?</p><p class="parabody">Unsurprisingly,
 the availability of source code for universal examination soon became 
the one and only benchmark of openness. What the code did was of little 
importance—the market knows best!—as long as anyone could check it for 
bugs. The new paradigm was presented as something that went beyond 
ideology and could attract corporate executives without losing its 
appeal to the hacker crowd. “The implication of [the open source] label 
is that we intend to convince the corporate world to adopt our way for 
economic, self-interested, non-ideological reasons,” <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2918">Eric Raymond noted in 1998</a>.
 What Raymond and O’Reilly failed to grasp, or decided to overlook, is 
that their effort to present open source as non-ideological was 
underpinned by a powerful ideology of its own—an ideology that worshiped
 innovation and efficiency at the expense of everything else.</p><p class="parabody">It
 took a lot of creative work to make the new paradigm stick. One common 
tactic was to present open source as having a much longer history that 
even predates 1998. Thus, writing shortly after O’Reilly’s historic open
 source summit, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2918">Raymond noted that</a>
 “the summit was hosted by O’Reilly &amp; Associates, a company that has
 been symbiotic with the Open Source movement for many years.” That the 
term “open source” was just a few months old by the time Raymond wrote 
this didn’t much matter. History was something that clever PR could 
easily fix. “As we thought about it, we said, gosh, this is also a great
 PR opportunity—we’re a company that has learned to work the PR angles 
on things,” <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kIU1scm4w6QC&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;ots=XymvERLdeY&amp;dq=%22So%20part%20of%20the%20agenda%20for%20the%20summit%20was%20hey%2C%20just%20to%20meet%20and%20find%20out%20what%20we%20had%20in%20common.%22&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">O’Reilly said in 1999</a><a href="http://131.130.46.67/wiki/index.php/Freie_und_Open_Source_Software_%28FOSS%29_%28OSP%29"></a>.
 “So part of the agenda for the summit was hey, just to meet and find 
out what we had in common. And the second agenda was really to make a 
statement of some kind [that] this was a movement, that all these 
different programs had something in common.” </p><p class="parabody">What
 they had in common was disdain for Stallman’s moralizing—barely enough 
to justify their revolutionary agenda, especially among the hacker 
crowds who were traditionally suspicious of anyone eager to suck up to 
the big corporations that aspired to dominate the open source scene. </p><p class="parabody">By
 linking this new movement to both the history of the Internet and its 
future, O’Reilly avoided most of those concerns. One didn’t have to 
choose open source, because the choice had already been made. As long as
 everyone believed that “open source” implied “the Internet” and that 
“the Internet” implied “open source,” it would be very hard to resist 
the new paradigm. As O’Reilly—always the PR man—<a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture_of_participation.html">wrote in a 2004 essay</a>,
 “It has always baffled and disappointed me that the open source 
community has not claimed the web as one of its greatest success 
stories. . . . That’s a PR failure!” To make up for that failure, 
O’Reilly had to establish some causal relationship between the two—the 
details could be worked out later on.</p>

<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“Openness” was the kind of multipurpose
 term that allowed one to look political while advancing an agenda that 
had very little to do with politics.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">“I think there’s a paradigm shift going
 on right now, and it’s really around both open source and the Internet,
 and it’s not entirely clear which one is the driver and which one is 
the passenger, but at least they are fellow travellers,” he announced in
 his <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/tim-oreilly-software-licenses-dont-work-261"><em>InfoWorld</em> interview</a>.
 Compared to the kind of universal excitement generated by the Internet,
 Stallman’s license-talk was about as exciting as performing Mahler at a
 Jay-Z concert. <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2000/06/09/java_keynote.html">As O’Reilly himself acknowledged</a>,
 his “emphasis in talking about open source has never been on the 
details of licenses, but on open source as a foundation and expression 
of the Internet.” When something is touted as both a foundation and an 
expression of something else, the underlying logic could probably 
benefit from more rigor.</p><p class="parabody">Telling a coherent story
 about open source required finding some inner logic to the history of 
the Internet. O’Reilly was up to the task. “If you believe me that open 
source is about Internet-enabled collaboration, rather than just about a
 particular style of software license,” <a href="http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/paradigmshift_0504.html">he said in 2000</a>,
 “you’ll see the threads that tie together not just traditional open 
source projects, but also collaborative ‘computing grid’ projects like 
SETIAtHome, user reviews on Amazon.com, technologies like collaborative 
filtering, new ideas about marketing such as those expressed in <em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em>,
 weblogs, and the way that Internet message boards can now move the 
stock market.” In other words, everything on the Internet was connected 
to everything else—via open source.</p><p class="parabody">The way 
O’Reilly saw it, many of the key developments of Internet culture were 
already driven by what he called “open source behavior,” even if such 
behavior was not codified in licenses. For example, the fact that one 
could view the source code of a webpage right in one’s browser has 
little to do with open source software, but it was part of the same 
“openness” spirit that O’Reilly saw at work in the Internet. No 
moralizing (let alone legislation) was needed; the Internet already 
lived and breathed open source. What O’Reilly didn’t say is that, of 
course, it didn’t have to be this way forever. Now that apps might be 
displacing the browser, the openness once taken for granted is no more—a
 contingency that licenses and morals could have easily prevented. 
Openness as a happenstance of market conditions is a very different 
beast from openness as a guaranteed product of laws.</p><p class="parabody">One
 of the key consequences of linking the Internet to the world of open 
source was to establish the primacy of the Internet as the new, 
reinvented desktop—as the greatest, and perhaps ultimate, platform—for 
hosting third-party services and applications. This is where the 
now-forgotten language of “freedom” made a comeback, since it was 
important to ensure that O’Reilly’s heroic Randian hacker-entrepreneurs 
were allowed to roam freely. Soon this “freedom to innovate” morphed 
into “Internet freedom,” so that what we are trying to preserve is the 
innovative potential of the platform, regardless of the effects on 
individual users.</p><p class="parabody">Stallman had on offer something
 far more precise and revolutionary: a way to think about the freedoms 
of individual users in specific contexts, as if the well-being of the 
mega-platform were of secondary importance. But that vision never came 
to pass. Instead, public advocacy efforts were channeled into preserving
 an abstract and reified configuration of digital technologies—“the 
Internet”—so that Silicon Valley could continue making money by 
hoovering up our private data.</p><p class="parabody">Lumping everything
 under the label of “Internet freedom” did have some advantages for 
those genuinely interested in promoting rights such as freedom of 
expression—the religious fervor that many users feel about the Internet 
has helped catalyze a lot of activist campaigns—but, by and large, the 
concept also blunted our analytical ability to balance rights against 
each other. Forced to choose between preserving the freedom of the 
Internet or that of its users, we were supposed to choose the 
former—because “the Internet” stood for progress and enlightenment.</p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the late 1990s, O’Reilly began celebrating “infoware” as the<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/tim.html"> next big thing</a>
 after “hardware” and “software.” His premise was that Internet 
companies such as Yahoo and E-Trade were not in the software business 
but in the infoware business. Their functionality was pretty basic—they 
allowed customers to make purchases or look up something on a map—so 
their value proposition lay in the information they delivered, not in 
the software function they executed. And all those fancy Internet 
services that made infoware possible were patched together with open 
source software. By showing that infoware was the future and that open 
source software was its essential component, O’Reilly sought to reassure
 those who hadn’t joined the movement of their pivotal role in the 
future of computing, if not all human progress.</p><p class="parabody">The
 “infoware” buzzword didn’t catch on, so O’Reilly turned to the work of 
Douglas Engelbart, the idiosyncratic inventor who gave us the computer 
mouse and hypertext, to argue that the Internet could help humanity 
augment its “collective intelligence” and that, once again, open source 
software was crucial to this endeavor. Now it was all about Amazon 
learning from its customers and Google learning from the sites in its 
index. The idea of the Internet as both a repository and incubator of 
“collective intelligence” was very appealing to Silicon Valley, not 
least because it tapped into the New Age rhetoric of the 1970s, but the 
dotcom crash briefly forced O’Reilly to put his philosophizing on hold. 
When the tech bubble burst, the demand for manuals and conferences—the 
bulk of O’Reilly’s business—shrank, while he also had to deal with some 
unpleasant litigation concerning his office headquarters in Sebastopol, 
California. He fired a quarter of his staff, and things looked pretty 
dire.</p>
<div style="float:right"><a href="http://www.marksfisher.com/"><img class="imageright" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher6_godsofinternet_308.png" alt=" "></a></div><p class="parabody">Then,
 in 2004, O’Reilly and his business partner Dale Dougherty hit on the 
idea of “Web 2.0.” What did “2.0” mean, exactly? There was some 
theoretical ambition to this label—more about that later on—but the 
primary goal was to show that the 2001 market crash did not mean the end
 of the web and that it was time to put the crash behind us and start 
learning from those who survived. Given how much rhetorical capital had 
been spent on linking the idea of the web with that of open source, the 
end of the web would also mean the end of so many other concepts. 
Tactically, “Web 2.0” could also be much bigger than “open source”; it 
was the kind of sexy umbrella term that could allow O’Reilly to branch 
out from boring and highly technical subjects to pulse-quickening 
futurology. “We normally have lots of technical talks focusing on how to
 use new software, building our conferences for the hackers who are 
inventing the future, and the early adopters who are taking their work 
to the next stage,” O’Reilly wrote in a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5466">blog post</a>
 announcing his very first Web 2.0 conference. “In contrast, Web 2.0 is 
our first ‘executive conference’—a conference aimed at business people, 
with the focus on the big picture.” </p><p class="parabody">Thus, a 
high-profile conference was born, aimed explicitly at helping VIPs in 
the Valley “see the shape of the future,” to be followed by many others.
 O’Reilly soon <a href="http://gossgrove.com/sites/default/files/web2009_websquared-whitepaper.pdf">expanded on the idea of Web 2.0</a>
 in an essay that he coauthored with writer and entrepreneur John 
Battelle. O’Reilly couldn’t improve on a concept as sexy as “collective 
intelligence,” so he kept it as the defining feature of this new 
phenomenon. What set Web 2.0 apart from Web 1.0, O’Reilly claimed, was 
the simple fact that those firms that didn’t embrace it went bust. All 
Silicon Valley companies should heed the lesson of those few who 
survived: they must find a way to harness collective intelligence and 
make it part of their business model. They must become true carriers of 
the Web 2.0 spirit.</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly’s explanation of the
 crash is curious. First of all, some tech companies that did go under 
(Global Crossing comes to mind) couldn’t harness collective 
intelligence, as they were in the telecommunications business. Most 
memorable dotcom failures—cases like Pets.com—went under because they 
were driven by foolish business models and overly exuberant investors. 
(Pets.com would have made an even worse proposition if it had followed 
O’Reilly’s playbook and become a Web 2.0 company.) Furthermore, 
companies that didn’t follow the Web 2.0 mantra—like Barnes &amp; Noble,
 which O’Reilly singled out as a company that, unlike Amazon, wasn’t 
learning from collective intelligence—didn’t go under at all.</p><p class="parabody">By 2007, O’Reilly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/10/todays-web-30-nonsense-blogsto.html">readily admitted</a>
 that “Web 2.0 was a pretty crappy name for what’s happening.” Back in 
2004, however, he seemed pretty serious, promoting this concept left and
 right. The label caught on; like “open source,” it was ambiguous and 
capacious enough to allow many alternative uses and interpretations. 
O’Reilly’s partners in organizing the conference duly trademarked the 
term “Web 2.0,” but this news wasn’t well received by their fellow 
travellers (a similar effort to trademark “open source” by the Open 
Source Initiative failed). Once “Web 2.0” was established as a term of 
cultural reference, O’Reilly could venture outside Silicon Valley and 
establish its relevance to other industries. Much as “open source 
software” gave rise to “open source politics” and “open source science,”
 so did “Web 2.0” expand its terminological empire. O’Reilly eventually 
stuck a 2.0 label on anything that suited his business plan, running 
events with titles like “Gov 2.0” and “Where 2.0.” Today, as everyone 
buys into the 2.0 paradigm, O’Reilly is quietly dropping it. Last year 
his “Where 2.0” conference on geolocation was rebranded as just “Where.”
 The exceptional has become the new normal.</p><p class="parabody">Sorting
 through the six thousand or so academic papers that cite O’Reilly’s 
essay on Web 2.0 is no easy feat. It seems that anyone who wanted to 
claim that a revolution was under way in their own field did so simply 
by invoking the idea of Web 2.0 in their work: <a href="https://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/4226">Development 2.0</a>, <a href="http://nlnjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/1536-5026-030.001.0048">Nursing 2.0</a>, <a href="http://inderscience.metapress.com/index/R765271R63403430.pdf">Humanities 2.0</a>, <a href="http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/33/6/923.short">Protest 2.0</a>, <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/jmte/2008/00000001/F0020002/art00004">Music 2.0</a>, <a href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/14628">Research 2.0</a>, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J115v26S01_02">Library 2.0</a>, <a href="http://www.iscramlive.org/ISCRAM2009/papers/Contributions/130_Disasters2.0-Application%20of%20Web2.0%20technologies_Camarero2009.pdf">Disasters 2.0</a>, <a href="https://domino.fov.uni-mb.si/proceedings.nsf/0/76115a8601158a71c1257757003bd6d6/$FILE/20_Fink.pdf">Road Safety 2.0</a>, <a href="http://operi.us/pdftribute/pdfs/helmond_identity20_dmiconference.pdf">Identity 2.0</a>, <a href="http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:386481">Stress Management 2.0</a>, <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2161947">Archeology 2.0</a>, <a href="http://champpenal.revues.org/7782">Crime 2.0</a>, <a href="http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2010-0111-200145/UUindex.html">Pornography 2.0</a>, <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/dddmp/journal/v9/n3/full/4350103a.html">Love 2.0</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Y_mCcY7b_uUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Wittgenstein+2.0+&amp;ots=FjMzz_ZuKT&amp;sig=AQ0diiYu3gaweQw6lyej5TglyDM#v=onepage&amp;q=Wittgenstein%202.0&amp;f=false">Wittgenstein 2.0</a>.
 What unites most of these papers is a shared background assumption 
that, thanks to the coming of Web 2.0, we are living through unique 
historical circumstances. Except that there was no coming of Web 2.0—it 
was just a way to sell a technology conference to a public badly burned 
by the dotcom crash. Why anyone dealing with stress management or 
Wittgenstein would be moved by the logistics of conference organizing is
 a mystery.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>O’Reilly stuck a 2.0 label on anything that suited his business plan.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">O’Reilly himself pioneered this 
2.0-ification of public discourse, aggressively reinterpreting trends 
that had been happening for decades through the prism of Internet 
history—a move that presented all those trends as just a logical 
consequence of the Web 2.0 revolution. Take <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/09/why-dell-dot-com-is-more-enterprise.html">O’Reilly’s musings</a>
 on “Enterprise 2.0.” What is it, exactly? Well, it’s the same old 
enterprise—for all we know, it might be making widgets—but now it has 
learned something from Google and Amazon and found a way to harness 
“collective intelligence.” For O’Reilly, Walmart is a quintessential 
Enterprise 2.0 company simply because it tracks what its customers are 
buying in real time. </p><p class="parabody">That this is a rather 
standard practice—known under the boring title of “just-in-time 
delivery”—predating both Google and Amazon didn’t register with 
O’Reilly. In a Web 2.0 world, all those older concepts didn’t matter or 
even exist; everything was driven by the forces of open source and the 
Internet. A revolution was in the making! </p><p class="parabody">This 
was a typical consequence of relying on Web 2.0 as the guiding metaphor 
of the age: in the case of Enterprise 2.0, a trend that had little 
connection to the Internet got reinscribed in the Internet frame, as if 
attaching the label of 2.0 was all that was needed to establish the 
logical parallels between the worlds of retail and search. This tendency
 to redescribe reality in terms of Internet culture, regardless of how 
spurious and tenuous the connection might be, is a fine example of what I
 call “Internet-centrism.” </p><p class="parabody">And soon Web 2.0 
became the preferred way to explain any changes that were happening in 
Silicon Valley and far beyond it. Most technology analysts simply 
borrowed the label to explain whatever needed explaining, taking its 
utility and objectivity for granted. “Open source” gave us the “the 
Internet,” “the Internet” gave us “Web 2.0,” “Web 2.0” gave us 
“Enterprise 2.0”: in this version of history, Tim O’Reilly is more 
important than the European Union. Everything needed to be rethought and
 redone: enterprises, governments, health care, finance, factory 
production. For O’Reilly, there were few problems that could not be <a href="http://www.web2summit.com/web2008">solved with Web 2.0</a>:
 “Our world is fraught with problems . . . from roiling financial 
markets to global warming, failing healthcare systems to intractable 
religious wars . . . many of our most complex systems are reaching their
 limits. It strikes us that the Web might teach us new ways to address 
these limits.” Web 2.0 was a source of didactic wisdom, and O’Reilly had
 the right tools to interpret what it wanted to tell us—in each and 
every context, be it financial markets or global warming. All those 
contexts belonged to the Internet now. Internet-centrism won.</p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n his 1976 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crazy-Talk-Stupid-Defeat-Ourselves/dp/0385281781"><em>Crazy Talk, Stupid Talk</em></a>,
 Neil Postman pointed to a certain linguistic imperialism that propels 
crazy talk. For Postman, each human activity—religion, law, marriage, 
commerce—represents a distinct “semantic environment” with its own tone,
 purpose, and structure. Stupid talk is relatively harmless; it presents
 no threat to its semantic environment and doesn’t cross into other 
ones. Since it mostly consists of falsehoods and opinions “given by one 
fallible human being about the remarks of another fallible human being,”
 it can be easily corrected with facts. For example, to say that Tehran 
is the capital of Iraq is stupid talk. Crazy talk, in contrast, 
challenges a semantic environment, as it “establishes different purposes
 and assumptions from those we normally accept.” To argue, as some Nazis
 did, that the German soldiers ended up far more traumatized than their 
victims is crazy talk.</p><p class="parabody">For Postman, one of the 
main tasks of language is to codify and preserve distinctions among 
different semantic environments. As he put it, “When language becomes 
undifferentiated, human situations disintegrate: Science becomes 
indistinguishable from religion, which becomes indistinguishable from 
commerce, which becomes indistinguishable from law, and so on. If each 
of them serves the same function, then none of them serves any function.
 When such a process is occurring, an appropriate word for it is <em>pollution.</em>”
 Some words—like “law”—are particularly susceptible to crazy talk, as 
they mean so many different things: from scientific “laws” to moral 
“laws” to “laws” of the market to administrative “laws,” the same word 
captures many different social relations. “Open,” “networks,” and 
“information” function much like “law” in our own Internet discourse 
today.</p><p class="parabody">Postman’s thinking on the inner workings of language was heavily influenced by the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski">Alfred Korzybski</a>, a Polish count now remembered—if at all—for his 1933 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Science-Sanity-Introduction-Non-Aristotelian-Semantics/dp/0937298018"><em>Science and Sanity</em></a>.
 Korzybski founded a movement called general semantics. While it has 
inspired many weird and dangerous followers—Scientology’s L. Ron Hubbard
 claimed to have been a fan—it also earned the support of many serious 
thinkers, from cyberneticians like Anatol Rapoport to philosophers like 
Gaston Bachelard. For Korzybski, the world has a relational structure 
that is always in flux; like Heraclitus, who argued that everything 
flows, Korzybski believed that an object A at time x1 is not the same 
object as object A at time x2 (he actually recommended indexing every 
term we use with a relevant numerical in order to distinguish “science 
1933” from “science 2013”). Our language could never properly account 
for the highly fluid and relational structure of our reality—or as he 
put it in his most famous aphorism, “the map is not the territory.”</p><p class="parabody">Korzybski
 argued that we relate to our environments through the process of 
“abstracting,” whereby our neurological limitations always produce an 
incomplete and very selective summary of the world around us. There was 
nothing harmful in this per se—Korzybski simply wanted to make people 
aware of the highly selective nature of abstracting and give us the 
tools to detect it in our everyday conversations. He wanted to 
artificially induce what he called a “neurological delay” so that we 
could gain more awareness of what we were doing in response to verbal 
and nonverbal stimuli, understand what features of reality have been 
omitted, and react appropriately. </p><p class="parabody">To that end, 
Korzybski developed a number of mental tools meant to reveal all the 
abstracting around us; he patented the most famous of those—the 
“structural differential”—in the 1920s. He also encouraged his followers
 to start using “etc.” at the end of their statements as a way of making
 them aware of their inherent inability to say everything about a given 
subject and to promote what he called the “consciousness of 
abstraction.” </p><p class="parabody">There was way too much craziness 
and bad science in Korzybski’s theories for him to be treated as a 
serious thinker, but his basic question—as Postman put it, “What are the
 characteristics of language which lead people into making false 
evaluations of the world around them?”—still remains relevant today.</p><p class="parabody">Tim
 O’Reilly is, perhaps, the most high-profile follower of Korzybski’s 
theories today. O’Reilly was introduced to Korzybski’s thought as a 
teenager while working with a strange man called George Simon in the 
midst of California’s counterculture of the early 1970s. O’Reilly and 
Simon were coteaching workshops at the Esalen Institute—then a hotbed of
 the “human potential movement” that sought to tap the hidden potential 
of its followers and increase their happiness. Bridging Korzybski’s 
philosophy with Sri Aurobindo’s integral yoga, Simon had an immense 
influence on the young O’Reilly. Simon’s rereading of general semantics,
 <a href="http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/favebooks_0705.html">noted O’Reilly in 2004</a>,
 “gave me a grounding in how to see people, and to acknowledge what I 
saw, that is the bedrock of my personal philosophy to this day.” (In 
1976 the twenty-two-year-old O’Reilly edited and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Notebooks-1965-1973-George-Simon/dp/B0006XM7K2/">published notebooks</a>
 by Simon after the latter died in an accident; even by the highly 
demanding standards of the 1970s, those notebooks look outright crazy.)</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly openly acknowledges his debt to Korzybski, listing <em>Science and Sanity </em>among <a href="http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/favebooks_0705.html">his favorite books</a> and even showing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir_7NJGhvsM">visualizations of the structural differential</a>
 in his presentations. It would be a mistake to think that O’Reilly’s 
linguistic interventions—from “open source” to “Web 2.0”—are random or 
spontaneous. There is a philosophy to them: a philosophy of knowledge 
and language inspired by Korzybski. However, O’Reilly deploys Korzybski 
in much the same way that the advertising industry deploys the latest 
findings in neuroscience: the goal is not to increase awareness, but to 
manipulate. If general semanticists aimed to reveal the underlying 
emptiness of many concepts that pollute the public debate, O’Reilly is 
applying some of Korzybski’s language insights to practice some 
pollution of his own.</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly, of course, sees 
his role differently, claiming that all he wants is to make us aware of 
what earlier commentators may have overlooked. “A metaphor is just that:
 a way of framing the issues such that people can see something they 
might otherwise miss,” <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/andrea_dimaio/2009/09/08/why-government-is-not-a-platform/">he wrote in response</a>
 to a critic who accused him of linguistic incontinence. But Korzybski’s
 point, if fully absorbed, is that a metaphor is primarily a way of 
framing issues such that we <em>don’t</em> see something we might otherwise see. </p><p class="parabody">In
 public, O’Reilly modestly presents himself as someone who just happens 
to excel at detecting the “faint signals” of emerging trends. He does so
 by monitoring a group of überinnovators that he dubs the “alpha geeks.”
 “The ‘alpha geeks’ show us where technology wants to go. Smart 
companies follow and support their ingenuity rather than trying to 
suppress it,” <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3123">O’Reilly writes</a>. His own function is that of an intermediary—someone who ensures that the alpha geeks are heard by the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2002/04/09/future.html">right executives</a>:
 “The alpha geeks are often a few years ahead of their time. . . . What 
we do at O’Reilly is watch these folks, learn from them, and try to 
spread the word by writing down (or helping them write down) what 
they’ve learned and then publishing it in books or online.” </p><p class="parabody">The name of his company’s blog—<em>O’Reilly Radar</em>—is
 meant to position him as an independent intellectual who is simply 
ahead of his peers in grasping the obvious. Some regular contributors to
 the <em>Radar </em>blog have titles like “<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/alexh">correspondents</a>,”
 giving the whole operation a veneer of objectivity and 
disinterestedness, with O’Reilly merely a commentator knowledgeable 
enough to provide some context to busy Silicon Valley types. An <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2982">Edwin Schlossberg quotation</a>
 he really likes—“the skill of writing is to create a context in which 
other people can think”—is cited to explain his willingness to enter so 
many seemingly unrelated fields. As Web 2.0 becomes central to 
everything, O’Reilly—the world’s biggest exporter of crazy talk—is on a 
mission to provide the appropriate “context” to every field.</p><p class="parabody">In
 a fascinating essay published in 2000, O’Reilly sheds some light on his
 modus operandi. The thinker who emerges there is very much at odds with
 the spirit of objectivity that O’Reilly seeks to cultivate in public. 
That essay, in fact, is a revealing ode to what O’Reilly dubs “<a href="http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a/495">meme-engineering</a>”:
 “Just as gene engineering allows us to artificially shape genes, 
meme-engineering lets us organize and shape ideas so that they can be 
transmitted more effectively, and have the desired effect once they are 
transmitted.” In a move worthy of Frank Luntz, O’Reilly meme-engineers a
 nice euphemism—“meme-engineering”—to describe what has previously been 
known as “propaganda.” </p><p class="parabody">The essay’s putative goal
 is to show how one can meme-engineer a new meaning for “peer-to-peer” 
technologies—traditionally associated with piracy—and make them appear 
friendly and not at all threatening to the entertainment industry. 
Leading by example, O’Reilly invokes his success in rebranding “free 
software” as “open source.” The key to success, he notes, was to “put a 
completely different spin on what formerly might have been considered 
the ‘same space.’” To make that happen, O’Reilly and his acolytes 
“changed the canonical list of projects that we wanted to hold up as 
exemplars of the movement,” while also articulating what broader goals 
the projects on the new list served. He then proceeds to rehash the 
already familiar narrative: O’Reilly put the Internet at the center of 
everything, linking some “free software” projects like Apache or Perl to
 successful Internet start-ups and services. As a result, the movement’s
 goal was no longer to produce a completely free, independent, and fully
 functional operating system but to worship at the altar of the Internet
 gods.</p><p class="parabody">Another apt example of O’Reilly’s 
meme-engineering is his attempt to establish a strong intellectual link 
between the development of Unix—a proprietary operating system that 
Stallman sought to replace with free software—and the development of 
open source and the Internet. Thus, for instance, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/the-past-and-future-of-open-computing">O’Reilly claimed</a>
 that Unix was built and improved in the spirit of open source because 
its academic cheerleaders were already swapping code with each other in 
the early 1970s. That such exchanges were just a regular part of the 
freewheeling academic culture and had little to do with philosophical 
attitudes toward code doesn’t weaken the argument; in fact, this is 
recast as an advantage, as now the open source model can be presented as
 just a natural extension of the scientific method. (Since O’Reilly 
himself played an important role in the production of Unix manuals, his 
own contribution to the Internet and open source suddenly looks even 
more significant.) </p><p class="parabody">But O’Reilly’s meme-engineering around Unix doesn’t just stop at the purely discursive level. In his <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2000/06/09/java_keynote.html">talks and writings</a>, O’Reilly often points to one highly technical 1984 book—<em>The Unix Programming Environment</em>—as proof that, at least with respect to collaboration, Unix was some kind of proto-Internet. Indeed, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment">Wikipedia page for the book</a>
 states that “the book is perhaps most valuable for its exposition of 
the Unix philosophy of small cooperating tools with standardized inputs 
and outputs, a philosophy that also shaped the end-to-end philosophy of 
the Internet. It is this philosophy, and the architecture based on it, 
that has allowed open source projects to be assembled into larger 
systems such as Linux, without explicit coordination between 
developers.” </p><p class="parabody">Could it be that O’Reilly is right 
in claiming that “open source” has a history that predates 1998? Well, 
Wikipedia won’t tell us much here: in a<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D3_2iCldUA"> recent Berkeley talk</a>,
 O’Reilly admitted that he was the one to edit the Wikipedia page for 
the book. O’Reilly is perfectly positioned to control our technology 
discourse: as a publisher, he can churn out whatever books he needs to 
promote his favorite memes—and, once those have been codified in book 
form, they can be easily admitted into Wikipedia, where they quickly 
morph into facts. What’s not to like about “collective intelligence”?</p>
<div style="float:right"><a href="http://www.marksfisher.com/"><img class="imageright" src="The%20Meme%20Hustler%20%7C%20Evgeny%20Morozov%20%7C%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher7_techspeak_308.png" alt=" "></a></div>
<p class="parabody">Seen through the prism of meme-engineering, O’Reilly’s activities look far more sinister. His “correspondents” at <em>O’Reilly Radar</em>
 don’t work beats; they work memes and epistemes, constantly reframing 
important public issues in accordance with the templates prophesied by 
O’Reilly. Recently, for example, O’Reilly has been interested in the 
meme of “<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/tag/industrial-internet">the industrial Internet</a>,”
 forming a partnership with GE to participate in events and cover the 
company on the blog. Once “the industrial Internet” meme is out of the 
bag, only a lack of imagination prevents O’Reilly’s writers from seeing 
it absolutely everywhere. Here is how <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/12/the-industrial-internet-from-a-startup-perspective.html">one of them describes</a>
 a company that might not otherwise fit the boundaries of the meme: “I’m
 sure [its founder] wouldn’t use the words ‘industrial Internet’ to 
describe what he and his team are doing, and it might be a little bit of
 a stretch to categorize 3Scan that way. But I think they are an 
exemplar of many of the core principles of the meme and it’s interesting
 to think about them in that frame.” Five years down the road, would you
 be surprised if there is, in fact, something called “the industrial 
Internet” and that the primary goal of most activism around it is to 
defend the freedom of GE to “innovate” on it as it pleases? </p><p class="parabody">Or take O’Reilly’s meme-engineering efforts around cyberwarfare. In a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/some-sideways-thinking-about-cyberwarfare.html">recent post</a>
 on the subject, he muses on just how narrowly we have defined the idea 
of “cyberwarfare” and suggests we expand it to encompass conflicts 
between states and individuals. Now, who stands to benefit from 
“cyberwarfare” being defined more broadly? Could it be those who, like 
O’Reilly, can’t currently grab a share of the giant pie that is 
cybersecurity funding? If O’Reilly’s meme-engineering efforts succeed, 
we might end up classifying acts that should be treated as crime, 
espionage, or terrorism under the ambiguous label of “war.” Such 
reframing would be disastrous for civil liberties and privacy and would 
only exacerbate the already awful legal prosecution of hacktivists. It 
probably won’t be long before a “cyberwarfare correspondent” is added to
 O’Reilly’s media empire.</p><p class="parabody">In his 2007 bestseller <em>Words That Work</em>,
 the Republican operative Frank Luntz lists ten rules of effective 
communication: simplicity, brevity, credibility, consistency, novelty, 
sound, aspiration, visualization, questioning, and context. O’Reilly, 
while employing most of them, has a few unique rules of his own. Clever 
use of visualization, for example, helps him craft his message in a way 
that is both sharp and open-ended. Thus, O’Reilly’s meme-engineering 
efforts usually result in “meme maps,” where the meme to be 
defined—whether it’s “open source” or “Web 2.0”—is put at the center, 
while other blob-like terms are drawn as connected to it.</p><p class="parabody">The
 exact nature of these connections is rarely explained in full, but this
 is all for the better, as the reader might eventually interpret 
connections with their own agendas in mind. This is why the name of the 
meme must be as inclusive as possible: you never know who your eventual 
allies might be. “A big part of meme engineering is giving a name that 
creates a big tent that a lot of people want to be under, a train that 
takes a lot of people where they want to go,” <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/language-is-a-map-pdf-with-notes">writes O’Reilly</a>.
 Once the meme has been conceived, the rest of O’Reilly’s empire can 
step in and help make it real. His conferences, for example, play a 
crucial role: “When you look at any of our events, there’s ultimately 
some rewriting of the meme map in each of them. <em>Web 2.0</em> was about distinguishing companies that survived the dotcom bust from those that didn’t. <em>Strata</em> is about defining the new field of data science. <em>Velocity</em>
 is about making clear that the applications of the web depend on people
 to keep them running, unlike past generations of software that were 
simply software artifacts.” </p><p class="parabody">There is considerable continuity across O’Reilly’s memes—over time, they tend to morph into one another. Thus, <a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/wlg/3017">as he puts it</a>,
 “‘open source’ was a great reshaping of the meme for its day, moving us
 off some of the limitations of ‘free software,’ but it may not be the 
end of the story.” O’Reilly has gradually lost interest in “open source”
 and “Web 2.0,” moving on to new memes: “government as a platform” and 
“algorithmic regulation.” We can only guess what comes next. Such 
dexterity not only helps in organizing new events and investing in cool 
start-ups; it also, as those six thousand papers that cite Web 2.0 
attest, leaves a huge imprint on our culture.</p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll the familiar pathologies of O’Reilly’s thinking are on full display in his quest to <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">meme-engineer his way</a>
 to “Government 2.0.” The free software scenario is repeating itself: 
deeply political reform efforts are no longer seen as “moral crusades,” 
but are reinvented as mere attempts at increasing efficiency and 
promoting innovation.</p><p class="parabody">Before O’Reilly went 
searching for a big-tent meme, there was little cohesion to the many 
disparate efforts to use technology to transform government. Some hoped 
that digitization would help reduce bureaucracy and allow everyone to 
fill out tax returns online. Others awaited the arrival of electronic 
town halls that would permit citizens to deliberate on the substance of 
policies that affect them. Yet another group hoped that digitization 
might make governments more transparent and accountable by forcing them 
to put some of the documents obtained through the Freedom of Information
 Act (FOIA) online. Finally, there were those who believed that 
increasing the availability and liquidity of government information 
would lead to new entrepreneurial projects and boost the economy.</p><p class="parabody">Many
 of these efforts started long before the web and had no obvious 
connection to Internet culture, let alone Web 2.0. Occasionally, these 
four efforts—aiming at greater efficiency, deliberation, transparency, 
and innovation—overlapped, but mostly they have been driven by two very 
different agendas. One cohort, interested in increasing efficiency and 
spurring innovation, pursued campaigns that were mostly economic in 
character; these folks were not particularly interested in the political
 nature of the regimes they were seeking to reform. Singapore—where 
anyone can file their paperwork in minutes—was their role model.</p><p class="parabody">The
 other cohort, interested in deliberation and transparency, was 
primarily concerned with transferring power from governments to citizens
 and increasing the accountability of public institutions. They argued 
that citizens have a right to obtain information about how their 
governments operate. Such explicitly political demands became the 
cornerstone of various Right to Information campaigns. This second group
 wouldn’t accept authoritarian Singapore as a role model, since most of 
its e-innovations do very little to promote meaningful citizen 
participation in policy-making or increase accountability.</p><p class="parabody">Most
 modern governments, not surprisingly, prefer the economic aspects of 
digitization reform to the political ones. Innovative schemes, like 
smart parking systems, can help at election time; lengthy disclosures of
 government deliberations are likely to cause headaches. Right-leaning 
governments have an extra reason to celebrate the economism of the first
 cohort: publishing aggregate information about the performance of 
individual public service providers may help convince the electorate 
that those services should be provided by the private sector.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>A clique of techno-entrepreneurs has hijacked our language and, with it, our reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="parabody">By the early 2000s, as O’Reilly and his comrades 
were celebrating open source as a new revolutionary approach to 
everything, their discussions wandered into debates about the future of 
governance. Thus, a term like “open government”—which, until then, had 
mostly been used as a synonym for “transparent and accountable 
government”—was reinvented as a shortened version of “open source 
government.” The implication of this subtle linguistic change was that 
the main cultural attributes of open source software—the availability of
 the source code for everyone’s inspection, the immense contribution it 
can make to economic growth, the new decentralized production model that
 relies on contributions from numerous highly distributed 
participants—were to displace older criteria like “transparency” or 
“accountability” as the most desirable attributes of open government. 
The coining of the “open government” buzzwords was meant to produce a 
very different notion of openness.</p><p class="parabody">Initially, 
O’Reilly had little role in this process; the meme of “open source” was 
promiscuous enough to redefine many important terms without his 
intervention. But in 2007, O’Reilly <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/">hosted yet another summit</a>, attended by technologists and civic hackers, to devise a list of key principles of open government. The group came up with <a href="https://public.resource.org/8_principles.html">eight principles</a>,
 all focused on the purely technical issue of how to ensure that, once 
data was released by the government, nothing would hold it back. As long
 as this “open data” was liquid and reusable, others could build on it. 
Neither the political process that led to the release of the data nor 
its content was considered relevant to openness. Thus, data about how 
many gum-chewers Singapore sends to prison would be “open” as long as 
the Singaporean government shared it in suitable formats. Why it shared 
such data was irrelevant. </p><p class="parabody">With Obama’s election,
 Washington was game for all things 2.0. This is when O’Reilly turned 
his full attention to government reform, deploying and manipulating 
several memes at once—“Gov 2.0,” “open government,” and “government as a
 platform”—in order to establish the semantic primacy of the economic 
dimension of digitization. A decade earlier, O’Reilly had redefined 
“freedom” as the freedom of developers to do as they wished; now it was 
all about recasting “openness” in government in purely economic and 
innovation-friendly terms while downplaying its political connotations.</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly’s writings on Gov 2.0 reveal the same talented meme-engineer who gave us open source and Web 2.0. In his <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">seminal essay on the subject</a>,
 O’Reilly mixes semantic environments without a shred of regret. Both 
Web 2.0 and Gov 2.0, he argues, return us to earlier, simpler ways, away
 from the unnecessary complexity of modern institutions. “Web 2.0 was 
not a new version of the World Wide Web; it was a renaissance after the 
dark ages of the dotcom bust, a rediscovery of the power hidden in the 
original design of the World Wide Web,” he writes. “Similarly, 
Government 2.0 is not a new kind of government; it is government 
stripped down to its core, rediscovered and reimagined as if for the 
first time.” </p><p class="parabody">Once it’s been established that new
 paradigms of government can be modeled on the success of technology 
companies, O’Reilly can argue that “it’s important to think deeply about
 what the three design principles of transparency, participation, and 
collaboration mean in the context of technology.” These were the very 
three principles that the Obama administration articulated in its “Open 
Government Directive,” published on the president’s first day in office.
 But why do we have to think about their meaning in “the context of 
technology”? The answer is quite simple: whatever transparency and 
participation used to mean doesn’t matter any longer. Now that we’ve 
moved to an era of Everything 2.0, the meaning of those terms will be 
dictated by the possibilities and inclinations of technology. And what 
is technology today if not “open source” and “Web 2.0”?</p><p class="parabody">Here, for example, is how O’Reilly tries to reengineer the meme of transparency:</p><blockquote><p>The
 word “transparency” can lead us astray as we think about the 
opportunity for Government 2.0. Yes, it’s a good thing when government 
data is available so that journalists and watchdog groups like the 
Sunlight Foundation can disclose cost overruns in government projects or
 highlight the influence of lobbyists. But that’s just the beginning. 
The magic of open data is that the same openness that enables 
transparency also enables innovation, as developers build applications 
that reuse government data in unexpected ways. Fortunately, Vivek Kundra
 and others in the administration understand this distinction, and are 
providing data for both purposes.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">Vivek Kundra is the former chief 
information officer of the U.S. government who oversaw the launch of a 
portal called data.gov, which required agencies to upload at least three
 “high-value” sets of their own data. This data was made “open” in the 
same sense that open source software is open—i.e., it was made available
 for anyone to see. But, once again, O’Reilly is dabbling in 
meme-engineering: the data dumped on data.gov, while potentially 
beneficial for innovation, does not automatically “enable transparency.”
 O’Reilly deploys the highly ambiguous concept of openness to confuse 
“transparency as accountability” (what Obama called for in his 
directive) with “transparency as innovation” (what O’Reilly himself 
wants).</p><p class="parabody">How do we ensure accountability? Let’s 
forget about databases for a moment and think about power. How do we 
make the government feel the heat of public attention? Perhaps by 
forcing it to make targeted disclosures of particularly sensitive data 
sets. Perhaps by strengthening the FOIA laws, or at least making sure 
that government agencies comply with existing provisions. Or perhaps by 
funding intermediaries that can build narratives around data—much of the
 released data is so complex that few amateurs have the processing power
 and expertise to read and make sense of it in their basements. This 
might be very useful for boosting accountability but useless for 
boosting innovation; likewise, you can think of many data releases that 
would be great for innovation and do nothing for accountability. The 
language of “openness” does little to help us grasp key differences 
between the two. In this context, openness leads to Neil Postman’s 
“crazy talk,” resulting in the pollution of the values of one semantic 
environment (accountability) with those of another (innovation).</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly
 doesn’t always coin new words. Sometimes he manipulates the meanings of
 existing words. Cue his framing of “participation”:</p><blockquote><p>We
 can be misled by the notion of participation to think that it’s limited
 to having government decision-makers “get input” from citizens. This 
would be like thinking that enabling comments on a website is the 
beginning and end of social media! It’s a trap for outsiders to think 
that Government 2.0 is a way to use new technology to amplify the voices
 of citizens to influence those in power, and by insiders as a way to 
harness and channel those voices to advance their causes.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">It’s hard to make sense of this passage
 without understanding the exact meaning of a term like “participation” 
in the glossary of All Things Web 2.0. According to O’Reilly, one of the
 key attributes of Web 2.0 sites is that they are based on an “<a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture_of_participation.html">architecture of participation</a>”;
 it’s this architecture that allows “collective intelligence” to be 
harnessed. Ranking your purchases on Amazon or reporting spammy emails 
to Google are good examples of clever architectures of participation. 
Once Amazon and Google start learning from millions of users, they 
become “smarter” and more attractive to the original users.</p><p class="parabody">This
 is a very limited vision of participation. It amounts to no more than a
 simple feedback session with whoever is running the system. You are not
 participating in the design of that system, nor are you asked to 
comment on its future. There is nothing “collective” about such 
distributed intelligence; it’s just a bunch of individual users acting 
on their own and never experiencing any sense of solidarity or group 
belonging. Such “participation” has no political dimension; no power 
changes hands.</p><p class="parabody">Occasionally, O’Reilly’s 
illustrations include activities that demand no actual awareness of 
participation—e.g., a blog that puts up links to other blogs ends up 
improving Google’s search index—which is, not coincidentally perhaps, 
how we think of “participation” in the market system when we go 
shopping. To imply that “participation” means the same thing in the 
context of Web 2.0 as it does in politics is to do the very opposite of 
what Korzybski and general semantics prescribe. Were he really faithful 
to those principles, O’Reilly would be pointing out the differences 
between the two—not blurring them.</p><p class="parabody">So what are we
 to make of O’Reilly’s exhortation that “it’s a trap for outsiders to 
think that Government 2.0 is a way to use new technology to amplify the 
voices of citizens to influence those in power”? We might think that the
 hallmark of successful participatory reforms would be enabling citizens
 to “influence those in power.” There’s a very explicit depoliticization
 of participation at work here. O’Reilly wants to redefine participation
 from something that arises from shared grievances and aims at 
structural reforms to something that arises from individual frustration 
with bureaucracies and usually ends with citizens using or building apps
 to solve their own problems.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>There 
is nothing “collective” about Amazon’s distributed intelligence; it’s 
just a bunch of individual users acting on their own.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">As a result, once-lively debates about 
the content and meaning of specific reforms and institutions are 
replaced by governments calling on their citizens to help find spelling 
mistakes in patent applications or use their phones to report potholes. 
If Participation 1.0 was about the use of public reason to push for 
political reforms, with groups of concerned citizens coalescing around 
some vague notion of the shared public good, Participation 2.0 is about 
atomized individuals finding or contributing the right data to solve 
some problem without creating any disturbances in the system itself. 
(These citizens do come together at “hackathons”—to help Silicon Valley 
liberate government data at no cost—only to return to their bedrooms 
shortly thereafter.) Following the open source model, citizens are 
invited to find bugs in the system, not to ask whether the system’s 
goals are right to begin with. That politics can aspire to something 
more ambitious than bug-management is not an insight that occurs after 
politics has been reimagined through the prism of open source software.</p><p class="parabody">Protest is one activity that <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/change-we-need-diy-civic-scale.html">O’Reilly hates passionately</a>.
 “There’s a kind of passivity even to our activism: we think that all we
 can do is to protest,” he writes. “Collective action has come to mean 
collective complaint. Or at most, a collective effort to raise money.” 
In contrast, he urges citizens to “apply the DIY spirit on a civic 
scale.” To illustrate the DIY spirit in action, O’Reilly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/change-we-need-diy-civic-scale.html">likes to invoke</a>
 the example of a Hawaiian community that, following a period of 
government inaction, raised $4 million and repaired a local park 
essential to its livelihood. For O’Reilly, the Hawaiian example reveals 
the natural willingness of ordinary citizens to solve their own 
problems. Governments should learn from Hawaii and offload more work 
onto their citizens; this is the key insight behind O’Reilly’s 
“government as a platform” meme.</p><p class="parabody">This platform 
meme was, of course, inspired by Silicon Valley. Instead of continuing 
to build its own apps, Apple built an App Store, getting third-party 
developers to do all the heavy lifting. This is the model that 
governments must emulate. In fact, notes O’Reilly, they once did: in the
 1950s, the U.S. government built a system of highways that allowed the 
private sector to build many more settlements around them, while in the 
1980s the Reagan administration started opening up the GPS system, which
 gave us amazing road directions and Foursquare (where O’Reilly is an 
investor).</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly’s prescriptions, as is often 
the case, do contain a grain of truth, but he nearly always exaggerates 
their benefits while obfuscating their costs. One of the main reasons 
why governments choose not to offload certain services to the private 
sector is not because they think they can do a better job at innovation 
or efficiency but because other considerations—like fairness and equity 
of access—come into play. “If Head Start were a start-up it would be out
 of business. It doesn’t work,” remarked O’Reilly in a <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/115851-oreilly-government-needs-to-close-the-feedback-loop">recent interview</a>. Well, exactly: that’s why Head Start is not a start-up.</p><p class="parabody">The
 real question is not whether developers should be able to submit apps 
to the App Store, but whether citizens should be paying for the apps or 
counting on the government to provide these services. To push for the 
platform metaphor as the primary way of thinking about the distribution 
of responsibilities between the private and the public sectors is to 
push for the economic-innovative dimension of Gov 2.0—and ensure that 
the private sector always emerges victorious.</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly
 defines “government as a platform” as “the notion that the best way to 
shrink the size of government is to introduce the idea that government 
should provide fewer citizen-facing services, but should instead 
consciously provide infrastructure only, with APIs and standards that 
let the private sector deliver citizen facing services.” <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">He believes that</a>
 “the idea of government as a platform applies to every aspect of the 
government’s role in society”—city affairs, health care, financial 
services regulation, police, fire, and garbage collection. “[Government 
as a platform] is the right way to frame the question of Government 
2.0.”</p><p class="parabody">One person who is busy turning the “government as a platform” meme into reality is David Cameron in the U.K. Cameron’s “<a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/big-society-speech/">Big Society</a>”
 idea is based on three main tenets: decentralization of power from 
London to local governments, making information about the public sector 
more transparent to citizens, and paying providers of public services 
based on the quality of their service, which, ideally, would be measured
 and published online, thanks to feedback provided by the public. The 
idea here is that the government will serve as a coordinator of sorts, 
allowing people to come together—perhaps even giving them seed funding 
to kick-start alternatives to inefficient public services.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Once-lively debates about reform are replaced by governments calling on their citizens to use their phones to report potholes.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">Cameron’s motivation is clear: the 
government simply has no money to pay for services that were previously 
provided by public institutions, and besides, shrinking the government 
is something his party has been meaning to do anyway. Cameron 
immediately grasped the strategic opportunities offered by the ambiguity
 of a term like “open government” and embraced it wholeheartedly—in its 
most apolitical, economic version, of course. At the same time that he 
celebrated the ability of “<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1345777/David-Cameron-Armchair-auditors-leave-councils-hide.html">armchair auditors</a>” to pore through government databases, he also criticized freedom of information laws, alleging that FOI requests are “<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9149322/What-price-freedom-of-information.html">furring up the arteries of government</a>”
 and even threatening to start charging for them. Francis Maude, the 
Tory politician who Cameron put in charge of liberating government data,
 is <a href="http://ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/article/view/845">on the record stating</a>
 that open government is “what modern deregulation looks like” and that 
he’d “like to make FOI redundant.” In 2011, Cameron’s government 
released a white paper on “<a href="http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Open Public Services</a>”
 that uses the word “open” in a peculiar way: it argues that, save for 
national security and the judiciary, all public services must become 
open to competition from the market.</p><p class="parabody">Here’s just 
one example of how a government that is nominally promoting Tim 
O’Reilly’s progressive agenda of Gov 2.0 and “government as a platform” 
is rolling back the welfare state and increasing government secrecy—all 
in the name of “openness.” The reason why Cameron has managed to get 
away with so much crazy talk is simple: the positive spin attached to 
“openness” allows his party to hide the ugly nature of its reforms. 
O’Reilly, who had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIlxdpfu71o">otherwise praised</a>
 the Government Digital Service, the unit responsible for the 
digitization of the British government, is aware that the “Big Society” 
might reveal the structural limitations of his quest for “openness.” 
Thus, he publicly <a href="http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2012/05/open-data-movement-redux-tribes-and-contradictions.html">distanced himself from Cameron</a>, complaining of “the shabby abdication of responsibility of Cameron’s Big Society.”</p><p class="parabody">But is this the same O’Reilly who <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">once claimed that</a>
 the goal of his proposed reforms is to “design programs and supporting 
infrastructure that enable ‘we the people’ to do most of the work”? His 
rejection of Cameron is pure PR, as they largely share the same 
agenda—not an easy thing to notice, as O’Reilly constantly alternates 
between two visions of open government. O’Reilly the good cop claims 
that he wants the government to release its data to promote more 
innovation by the private sector, while O’Reilly the bad cop wants to 
use that newly liberated data to shrink the government. “There is no 
Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’ to bring unneeded government 
programs to an end,” <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">he lamented in 2010</a>.
 “Government 2.0 will require deep thinking about how to end programs 
that no longer work, and how to use the platform power of the government
 not to extend government’s reach, but instead, how to use it to better 
enable its citizenry and its economy.” <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIlxdpfu71o">Speaking to British civil servants</a>,
 O’Reilly positions open government as the right thing to do in times of
 austerity, not just as an effective way to promote innovation. </p><p class="parabody">After <em>The New Yorker</em> ran a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/25/101025fa_fact_collins">long, critical article</a> on the Big Society in 2010, Jennifer Pahlka—O’Reilly’s key ally, who runs an NGO called Code for America—quickly <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2010/10/29/the-challenges-of-do-it-ourselves-dio-government/">moved to dismiss</a>
 any parallels between Cameron and O’Reilly. “The beauty of the 
government as a platform model is that it doesn’t assume civic 
participation, it encourages it subtly by aligning with existing 
motivations in its citizens, so that anyone—ranging from the fixers in 
Hawaii to the cynics in Britain—would be willing to get involved,” she 
noted in a blog post. “We’d better be careful we don’t send the wrong 
message, and that when we’re building tools for citizen engagement, we 
do it in the way that taps existing motivations.” </p><p class="parabody">But what kinds of “existing motivations” are there to be tapped? O’Reilly writes that, in <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2010/10/29/the-challenges-of-do-it-ourselves-dio-government/#comment-92778371">his ideal future</a>,
 governments will be “making smart design decisions, which harness the 
self-interest of society and citizens to achieve positive results.” 
That, in fact, is how his favorite technology platforms work: users tell
 Google that some of their incoming email is spam in order to improve 
their own email experience. In other words, it’s self-interest through 
and through. “The architecture of Linux, the Internet, and the World 
Wide Web are such that users pursuing their own ‘selfish’ interests 
build collective value as an automatic byproduct,” <a href="http://oreilly.com/lpt/a/6228">writes O’Reilly</a>.
 This is also how the likes of Eric Raymond explain the motivation of 
those contributing to open source projects—they do it for strictly 
selfish reasons. “The ‘utility function’ Linux hackers are maximizing is
 not classically economic, but is the intangible of their own ego 
satisfaction and reputation among other hackers,” <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s11.html">Raymond writes</a> in <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em>.
 He goes on to say that “one may call their motivation ‘altruistic’, but
 this ignores the fact that altruism is itself a form of ego 
satisfaction for the altruist.” If it sounds like Ayn Rand, that’s 
because Raymond <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s10.html">explicitly draws on her crazy talk</a>. </p><p class="parabody">When
 pressed, O’Reilly the good cop refuses to acknowledge that his thinking
 about open government is not very different from Raymond’s thinking 
about open source software. When earlier this year Nathaniel Tkacz, a 
media academic, <a href="http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/nathaniel-tkacz-open-source-government/">noted these similarities</a>,
 O’Reilly complained that he was “a bit surprised to learn that my ideas
 of ‘government as a platform’ are descended from Eric Raymond’s ideas 
about Linux, since: a) Eric is a noted libertarian with disdain for 
government b) Eric’s focus on Linux was on its software development 
methodology.” Well, perhaps O’Reilly shouldn’t act so surprised: as 
Tkacz points out, O’Reilly’s writings on “government as a platform” 
explicitly credit Raymond as the source of the metaphor. <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">O’Reilly in 2011</a>: “In <em>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</em>,
 Eric Raymond uses the image of a bazaar to contrast the collaborative 
development model of open source software with traditional software 
development, but the analogy is equally applicable to government.” </p><p class="parabody">But
 is it really? Applied to politics, all this talk of bazaars, existing 
motivations, and self-interest treats citizenship as if it were fully 
reducible to market relations—yet another form of crazy talk. And it 
doesn’t easily square with the aspirations to active citizenship 
implicit in the “DIY spirit on a civic scale.” Of course, with some 
clever PR, one can say that the Hawaiians who rebuilt their park had 
some “existing motivations,” like having to earn a living to stay alive.
 But if the bar for “existing motivations” is set so low, then there are
 no limits to dismantling the welfare state and replacing it with some 
wild DIY hacker culture. Why do we need an expensive health care system 
if people have “existing motivations” to self-monitor at home and 
purchase drugs directly from Big Pharma? Why bother with police if we 
can print out guns at home—thanks, 3-D printers!—and we are already 
highly motivated to stay alive? </p><p class="parabody">Once we follow <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/change-we-need-diy-civic-scale.html">O’Reilly’s exhortation</a>
 not to treat the government as “the deus ex machina that we’ve paid to 
do for us what we could be doing for ourselves,” such questions are hard
 to avoid. In all of O’Reilly’s theorizing, there’s not a hint as to 
what political and moral principles should guide us in applying the 
platform model. Whatever those principles are, they are certainly not 
exhausted by appeals to innovation and efficiency—which is the language 
that O’Reilly wants us to speak.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>O’Reilly
 is perfectly positioned to control our technology discourse: he can 
churn out whatever books he needs to promote his favorite memes.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">The fundamental problem with O’Reilly’s
 vision is that, on the one hand, it’s all about having the private 
sector build new services that were unavailable when the government ran 
the show. Thus, it’s all about citizen-consumers, guided by the 
Invisible Hand, creating new value out of thin air. But O’Reilly also 
likes to invoke “DIY spirit on a civic scale” to call on citizens to 
take on functions that were previously performed by the government (even
 if poorly); here, we are not building new services—we are outsourcing 
public services to the private sector. O’Reilly’s logic in a nutshell: 
the government didn’t have to build its own Foursquare—hence, disaster 
response should be delegated to the private sector. Is the government 
meant to be a platform for providing services or for stimulating 
innovation? It’s certainly both—but the principles that ought to 
regulate its behavior in each case are certainly different. </p><p class="parabody">For
 O’Reilly, the memes of “Government 2.0” and “government as a platform” 
serve one major function: they make him relevant to the conversation 
about governance and politics, allowing him to expand his business into 
new territories. The Internet and open source have become universal 
connectors that can relate anything to anything. “Just as the interstate
 highway system increased the vitality of our transportation 
infrastructure, it is certainly possible that greater government 
involvement in health care could do the same,” <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">he writes</a>. Got it? But what if the dynamics of building highways are different from those of providing health care? What then? </p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">O</span>’Reilly’s
 attempts to meme-engineer how we think about politics are all the more 
disturbing for the deeply reductionist, anti-democratic flavor of his 
own politics. Positivist to his core, O’Reilly believes that there is 
just one right answer to policy dilemmas, and that it’s the job of the 
government (for him, it’s all just “government”) to produce legislation 
that gets at this “right” answer and then pass the necessary measures to
 make it happen. The means don’t much matter; it’s all about the 
ends—and the ends are perfectly knowable, as long as we have the data.</p><p class="parabody">O’Reilly’s latest meme, which he calls “<a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/CPiAX9YiVUB">algorithmic regulation</a>,”
 was inspired by—what else?—the Internet. This idea, writes O’Reilly, 
“is central to all Internet platforms, and provides a fruitful area for 
investigation in the design of 21st century government.” This is how he 
explained it in a <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/sep/05/birth-global-mind/">recent talk</a> at the Long Now Foundation: </p><blockquote><p>If
 you look at, say, the way spam is regulated on the Internet, that’s the
 beginnings of a kind of an immune system response to a pathogen and 
works a lot like biology: you recognize the signature of something new 
and hostile and you fix it. . . . You compare that to how government 
regulation works, and you go: “It’s just badly broken!” Somebody puts 
out some rules, and there’s no method of enforcement.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">Not a very sharp definition yet, but 
this is how many of O’Reilly’s memes start. Once he’s cornered the meme,
 his “correspondents” will do the rest, highlighting it in their blog 
posts and reports. (“In the future, better outcomes might come . . . 
through adopting what Tim O’Reilly has described as ‘algorithmic 
regulation,’ applying the dynamic feedback loops that web giants use to 
police their systems against malware and spam in government agencies 
entrusted with protecting the public interest,” <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/rethinking-regulatory-reform-in-the-internet-age.html">writes Alex Howard</a>, the “Government 2.0” correspondent of<em> O’Reilly Radar</em>.) </p><p class="parabody">Quite
 appropriately, the only political institution that corresponds to 
O’Reilly’s vision for “algorithmic regulation” is a central bank. 
Central banks have very clear, numerical targets—they know what’s 
“right” and don’t have to bother with deliberations—and they try to meet
 those targets with just a few specific tools at their disposal. They 
love feedback and think like Google. According to O’Reilly, the way they
 regulate is “kind of like the way Google regulates. They kind of say: I
 have an outcome in mind and a couple of knobs and levers. Periodically,
 I might get a few new knobs and levers, and I tweak them to get the 
outcome. I don’t just sort of say: This is a rule and I’m going to 
follow it regardless of whether it has a good outcome or a bad outcome.”
 Central banks are elegant and simple; they just do stuff, instead of 
succumbing to, well, politics. “[In central banks] we have a couple of 
levers, and we keep tweaking them to see if we can get where we want to 
go. And that’s really how I would like to see us thinking about 
government regulatory processes.”</p><p class="parabody">Expanding on this notion of “algorithmic regulation,” O’Reilly reveals his inner technocrat:</p><blockquote><p>I
 remember having a conversation with Nancy Pelosi not long after Google 
did their Panda search update, and it was in the context of SOPA/PIPA. .
 . . [Pelosi] said, “Well, you know, we have to satisfy the interests of
 the technology industry <em>and</em> the movie industry.” And I 
thought, “No, you don’t. You have to get the right answer.” So that’s 
the reason I mentioned Google Panda search update, when they downgraded a
 lot of people who were building these content farms and putting low 
quality content in order to get pageviews and clicks in order to make 
money and not satisfy the users. And I thought, “Gosh, what if Google 
had said, yeah, yeah, we have to sit down with Demand Media and satisfy 
their concerns, we have to make sure that at least 30 percent of the 
search results are crappy so that their business model is preserved.” 
You wouldn’t do that. You’d say, “No, we have to get it right!” And I 
feel like, we don’t actually have a government that actually understands
 that it has to be building a better platform that starts to manage 
things like that with the best outcome for the real users. <em>[loud applause]</em></p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">Here O’Reilly dismisses the 
entertainment industry as just “wrong,” essentially comparing them to 
spammers. But what makes Google an appropriate model here? While it has 
obligations to its shareholders, Google doesn’t owe anything to the 
sites in its index. Congress was never meant to work this way. SOPA and 
PIPA were bad laws with too much overreach, but to claim that the 
entertainment industry has no legitimate grievances against piracy seems
 bizarre. </p><p class="parabody">Underpinning O’Reilly’s faith in 
algorithmic regulation is his naive belief that big data, harnessed 
through collective intelligence, would allow us to get at the right 
answer to every problem, making both representation and deliberation 
unnecessary. After all, why let contesting factions battle it out in the
 public sphere if we can just study what happens in the real world—with 
our sensors, databases, and algorithms? No wonder O’Reilly ends up 
claiming that “we have to actually start moving away from the notion 
that politics really has very much to do with governance. To the extent 
that we can fix things without politics, we’d be much better off.” It’s 
the ultimate conceit of Silicon Valley: if only we had more data and 
better tools, we could suspend politics once and for all.</p><p class="parabody">The magic “feedback” that O’Reilly touts so passionately is really the voice of the market—and <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html">occasionally he lets that slip</a>:
 “Government programs must be designed from the outset not as a fixed 
set of specifications, but as open-ended platforms that allow for 
extensibility and revision by the marketplace. Platform thinking is an 
antidote to the complete specifications that currently dominate the 
government approach not only to IT but to programs of all kinds.” But we
 prefer to have complete specifications at the outset not because no one
 had thought of building dynamic feedback systems before O’Reilly but 
because this is the only way to ensure that everyone’s grievances are 
addressed before the policies are implemented.</p><p class="parabody">His
 treatment of feedback as essentially an Internet phenomenon is vintage 
O’Reilly. As long as “algorithmic regulation” is defined against a 
notion like Web 2.0, O’Reilly feels no need to engage with the vast body
 of thought on feedback systems and the sociology of performance 
indicators. That most of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feedback-Thought-Social-Science-Systems/dp/1883823463">ideas behind algorithmic regulation</a>
 were articulated by the likes of Karl Deutsch and David Easton in the 
1960s would probably be news to O’Reilly. Nor is his intellectual 
equilibrium perturbed by the fact that the RAND Corporation was pitching
 something very similar to “algorithmic regulation” to American cities 
in the late 1960s in the hopes of making city governance <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Warfare-Welfare-Defense-Intellectuals-Problems/dp/0801882737">more cybernetic</a>. The plans, alas, didn’t work; the models could never account for the messy reality of urban life. </p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>It’s
 the ultimate conceit of Silicon Valley: if only we had more data and 
better tools, we could suspend politics once and for all.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">A decade before he wrote <em>Science and Sanity</em>, Alfred Korzybski wrote another weird book—<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manhood-Humanity-Alfred-Korzybski/dp/1463748000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364695542&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Manhood+of+Humanity"><em>Manhood of Humanity</em></a>.
 He, too, was very keen on feedback. “Philosophy, law and ethics, to be 
effective in a dynamic world must be dynamic; they must be made vital 
enough to keep pace with the progress of life and science,” he 
proclaimed. Korzybski’s solution, surprisingly, also lay in turning 
government into an algorithmically driven platform: “A natural first 
step would probably be the establishment of a new institution which 
might be called a Dynamic Department—Department of Coordination or a 
Department of Cooperation—the name is of little importance, but it would
 be the <em>nucleus </em>of the new civilization.” Like O’Reilly’s 
“government as a platform,” this new department would aspire to enable 
citizens. “Its functions,” wrote Korzybski, “would be those of 
encouraging, helping and protecting the people in such cooperative 
enterprises as agriculture, manufactures, finance, and distribution.” </p><p class="parabody">Korzybski
 envisioned this new scientific government to consist of ten sections, 
which ranged from the Section of Mathematical Sociology or Humanology 
(“composed of at least one sociologist, one biologist, one mechanical 
engineer, and one mathematician”) to the Section of Mathematical 
Legislation (“composed of (say) one lawyer, one mathematician, one 
mechanical engineer”) and from the Promoters’ Section (“composed of 
engineers whose duty would be to study all of the latest scientific 
facts, collect data, and elaborate plans”) to the News Section (its task
 would be “to edit a large daily paper giving true, uncolored news with a
 special supplement relating to progress in the work of Human 
Engineering”).</p><p class="parabody">For all his insight into the 
nature of language and reality, Korzybski was a kooky technocrat who 
believed that science could resolve all political problems. He would 
certainly agree with O’Reilly that there is one right way to decide on 
pending legislation and that any issues and controversies that come up 
in deliberations are just semantic noise—clever meme-engineering by the 
parties involved. Scientism is still scientism, even when it’s clothed 
in the rhetoric of big data.</p><p class="parabody"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t
 least O’Reilly is perfectly clear about how people can succeed in the 
future. Toward the end of his Long Now Foundation talk, he admits that</p><blockquote><p>[the]
 future of collective intelligence applications is a future in which the
 individual that we prize so highly actually has less power—except to 
the extent that that individual is able to create new mind storms. . . .
 How will we influence this global brain? The way we’ll influence it is 
seen in the way that people create these viral storms . . . . We’re 
going to start getting good at that. People will be able to command vast
 amounts of attention and direct large groups of people through new 
mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote><p class="parabody">Yes, let that thought sink in: our 
Mindstormer-in-Chief is telling us that the only way to succeed in this 
brave new world is to become a Tim O’Reilly. Anyone fancy an O’Reilly 
manual on meme hustling?</p>

<div><p id="footnote1" class="footnote"><a href="#anchor">[*Author’s note:]</a>
 In researching this essay, I tried to read all of O’Reilly’s published 
writings: blog posts, essays, tweets. I read many of his interviews and 
pored over the comments he left on blogs and news sites. I watched all 
his talks on YouTube. But I decided against interviewing him. First of 
all, I don’t believe in interviewing spin doctors: the interviewer 
learns nothing new while the interviewee gets an extraordinary 
opportunity to spin the story even before it’s published. Second, my 
goal in writing this essay was not to profile O’Reilly. Of course, I 
could have told you all about the wonderful jams—plum, blackberry, 
raspberry, peach—that he likes to make in his spare time. I left out 
such trivia on purpose, as my main interest has been O’Reilly the 
thinker, not O’Reilly the human being. Serious thinkers can be judged by
 their published output alone. Third, the only two emails that I ever 
received from him hinted at his penchant for heavy-handed manipulation 
of the media. The first email arrived long before I started working on 
this essay. It was a complaint about something I had written about him 
in the past, a throwaway line in a long essay—a complaint I believe to 
be without merit. The second email came right after I finished writing 
the first draft, which, by coincidence, happened to be on the very day 
that O’Reilly and I had a brief but feisty exchange on Twitter (he 
initiated it). In that second email, he offered to explain all his 
positions to me face to face—an opportunity I turned down, having just 
spent three months of my life reading his tweets, blog posts, and 
essays. That said, I have no doubt that everything in this essay will be
 meme-engineered against me.</p>
